 How to Collaborate on a Private GitHub Project

1. Get Access to the Repository  
  - The repository owner must add you as a collaborator.
  - Go to the repository on GitHub → Settings → Manage Access → Invite Collaborators.
  - You’ll receive an invitation to access the project.

2. Accept the Invitation  
  - Accept the invite via email or through GitHub.
  - Once accepted, you'll have access to the private repository.

3. Clone the Repository  
  - Clone the project to your local machine using git clone.
  - Example: git clone https://github.com/username/private-repo.git    

4. Set Up SSH or HTTPS for Authentication  
  - If using HTTPS, you’ll be prompted for your GitHub username and password (or personal access token).
  - If using SSH, set up SSH keys by following GitHub’s guide and use the SSH URL for cloning.

5. Create a Branch for Your Work  
  - Always work on a separate branch to avoid conflicts.
  - Example: git checkout-b new-feature
     

6. Push Changes to Remote  
  - After committing your changes locally, push them to the remote repository.
  - Example: git push origin new-feature    

7. Create a Pull Request  
  - Once your feature or fix is complete, go to GitHub and create a pull request.
  - The repository owner or team can review and merge your changes.

8. Collaborate with Team Members  
  - Communicate with team members using GitHub issues, comments, and pull requests.
  - Resolve merge conflicts if multiple people edit the same code.

9. Sync with the Latest Changes  
  - Regularly fetch and merge changes from the main branch to keep your branch updated.
  - Example:
    git fetch origin
    git merge origin/main
     
10. Revert Changes if Needed  
  - If something goes wrong, use git revert to undo changes or git reset to remove commits.
