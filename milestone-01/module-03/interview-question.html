### Difference Between Git and GitHub

Git:
- Version control system (VCS) for tracking code changes.
- Command-line tool (e.g., `git init`, `git commit`).
- Used locally to manage code history.
- Example: `git init` to initialize a repository.

GitHub:
- Cloud platform for hosting Git repositories.
- Web-based with features like `pull request` and `issues`.
- Used for collaboration and sharing code online.
- Example: Creating a repository on GitHub and pushing code.

 
 1) What is Git? What are the advantages of using Git?
Answer:  
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes to files in a project.  
Advantages:  
- Version history: Tracks changes over time.
- Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project.
- Branching: Work on separate branches without affecting the main codebase.

 2) What do you understand by the term ‘Version Control System’?
Answer:  
A Version Control System (VCS) tracks and manages changes to files, allowing multiple users to collaborate and keep a history of changes made.

Explanation:  
It helps in keeping track of file versions, allowing easy rollback and collaboration without overwriting each other's work.

 3) What’s the difference between Git and GitHub?
Answer:  
- Git: A tool for tracking changes in your code.
- GitHub: A platform that hosts Git repositories online, allowing easy sharing and collaboration.

Explanation:  
Git is used locally on your machine, while GitHub is an online service that stores your Git repositories and provides collaboration features.

 4) Name a few Git commands with their function.
Answer:  
- git init: Initializes a new Git repository.
- git clone: Clones a remote repository to your local machine.
- git add: Stages changes for commit.
- git commit: Commits staged changes to the repository.
- git push: Pushes local commits to a remote repository.

 5) Difference between git fetch and git pull.
Answer:  
- git fetch: Downloads updates from a remote repository but doesn’t merge them into your local branch.
- git pull: Downloads and merges changes from the remote repository into your local branch.

Explanation:  
git fetch just updates your local view of the remote repository without affecting your local files. git pull combines fetching and merging into one step.

 6) What is a commit in Git?
Answer:  
A commit is a snapshot of changes made to files in a repository. Each commit has a unique identifier.

Explanation:  
Commits help keep a record of what changes were made and why. They serve as checkpoints in the project history.

 7) What is a pull request (PR) on GitHub?
Answer:  
A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch into another, typically from a feature branch to the main branch.

Explanation:  
PRs allow team members to review and discuss changes before merging them into the main codebase.

 8) How do you create a new branch in Git?
Answer:  
Use the following commands:  
- git branch <branch-name>: Creates a new branch.  
- git checkout <branch-name>: Switches to the new branch.  
Or combine both:  
- git checkout -b <branch-name>: Creates and switches to the new branch.

 9) How do you resolve a merge conflict in Git?
Answer:  
Git marks the conflicting areas in the file. You need to manually edit the file, resolve the conflict, and then commit the changes.

Explanation:  
Merge conflicts happen when two people make changes to the same part of a file. Git cannot decide which change to keep, so it asks you to resolve it manually.

 10) What is a fork in GitHub, and why would you use it?
Answer:  
A fork is a copy of a repository that allows you to make changes without affecting the original repository.

Explanation:  
Forking is commonly used in open-source projects where you want to make changes but don't have direct access to the main repository.

 11) How do you push changes to a remote Git repository?
Answer:  
After committing changes, use git push origin <branch-name> to push the changes to the remote repository.

Explanation:  
This command uploads your local commits to the remote server, making them visible to others.

 12) What is the purpose of git status?
Answer:  
git status shows the current state of your working directory and staging area, indicating which changes have been staged, committed, or not tracked.

Explanation:  
It's a helpful command to see what changes are ready to be committed and which files are modified but not yet added.

 13) What is a GitHub repository?
Answer:  
A repository on GitHub is a location where your project files and version history are stored.

Explanation:  
GitHub repositories can be either public or private, and they hold all the files and commit history of a project.

 14) What is the difference between git commit and git push?
Answer:  
- git commit: Saves changes to your local repository.
- git push: Sends the local commits to a remote repository.

Explanation:  
git commit stores changes in your local repository, while git push uploads those changes to a shared remote repository.
