 Difference Between cd \my-first-github-repo and cd my-first-github-repo

- cd \my-first-github-repo  
  - Absolute path: Moves directly to C:\my-first-github-repo, no matter where you are.
  - If the folder doesn't exist at that location, you'll get an error.

- cd my-first-github-repo  
  - Relative path: Moves to my-first-github-repo from your current directory.
  - It only works if the folder is in your current directory.

 How to Go Back and Forward Folders

- Go back one folder (up)  
  - Use cd .. to move up one directory level.
  - Example: If you're in C:\Users\Redoy Al Hasan\Desktop\CodingHero\milestone-01\module-03\my-first-github-repo, running cd .. takes you to C:\Users\Redoy Al Hasan\Desktop\CodingHero\milestone-01\module-03.

- Go forward to a subdirectory  
  - Use cd folder-name to move into a subfolder.
  - Example: From C:\Users\Redoy Al Hasan\Desktop\CodingHero\milestone-01\module-03, cd my-first-github-repo will move you to that folder.
